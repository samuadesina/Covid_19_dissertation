# Project: Modelling the Impact of Vaccination Rates on the Transmission Dynamics of the Coronavirus using Epidemological models

This project intends to predict the effect of vaccination rates on the dynamics of coronavirus transmission while taking into account the virus's rate of reproduction and the rate of decreasing instances. The objective is to find out how different levels of vaccine coverage can affect how the virus spreads and help understand how government policies affected the impact of COVID-19 across various regions.

## Project Plan:

### Data Gathering:

- Obtain data from Google data sources on COVID-19, such as Google COVID-19 Mobility Reports, Google Trends, and [Google COVID-19 COVID-19 Open Data Repository](https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/).
- Collect data from online data resources, such as government health agencies, research institutions, and publicly available datasets.
- Ensure data includes information on coronavirus cases, vaccination rates, hospitalizations, deaths, decline rates, reproduction rates, and various countries including Nigeria,  South Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, China, Saudi Arabia etc. The idea is to gather data for at least, two countries per continent.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Clean the collected data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Perform data scaling and normalization techniques to make variables comparable.
- Explore data distributions and correlations to gain insights into the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Analyze the dataset based on various factors, including hospitalization rate, death rate, decline rate, reproduction rate, and policies developed across the various regions.
- Visualize data through graphs, charts, and maps to identify patterns and trends.
- Calculate descriptive statistics to summarize key aspects of the spread of COVID-10.

### Model Selection:

- Determine the appropriate epidemiological model for the analysis, such as compartmental models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) or agent-based models.
- Consider the strengths, limitations, and assumptions of different models.
- Discuss the selected model and its justification with project supervisor, providing additional information on the model's theoretical foundations, equations, and parameters.

### Model Implementation:

- Implement the chosen epidemiological model using a suitable programming language, such as Python.
- Define the model's equations, initial conditions, and parameters based on the dataset and relevant literature.
- Validate the model by comparing its outputs to real-world data and existing epidemiological studies.

### Model Calibration and Parameter Estimation:

- Calibrate the model's parameters using optimization techniques or statistical methods.
- Fit the model to observed data to ensure it accurately represents the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus.
- Document the calibration process, including the chosen optimization algorithm and the criteria for parameter estimation.

### Model Simulation and Analysis:

- Run simulations with different vaccination rate scenarios to assess their impact on the transmission dynamics.
- Calculate relevant metrics, such as effective reproduction number, herd immunity threshold, and reduction in hospitalizations and deaths.
- Analyze the simulation results to evaluate the effectiveness of various vaccination policies and identify optimal strategies.

### Interpretation and Reporting:

- Interpret the findings from the model simulations and analysis.
- Discuss the implications of the results, including the relationship between vaccination rates and transmission dynamics.
- Provide recommendations for effective policies based on the observed outcomes.
- Document the entire process in the dissertation, including details on data sources, model equations, parameter estimation methods, and limitations of the project.
